## About

**DuckWordle** is the classic Wordle game where you must guess a five-letter word, but with a twist: all the words are related to **ducks**. This repository was created for recreational purposes and as part of the course *Algorithms and Computational Systems (IIC1001)* in the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.
